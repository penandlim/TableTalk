###TODO: 
* (1) moving the server side part to a real domain name 
* (2) signing it with a 'let's encrypt' ssl cert 
* (3) redirecting anything to the new domain 
* (4) adding a POST API call for adding a new message thread. That way we won't have security issues any more. (5) adding visual indicator for new replies or new message threads 
* (6) running scheduled job on db to calculate popularity of each thread
